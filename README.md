# Unsolved Problems
-I was unable to figure out a way to track every click from the user to see if it was correct. It checks aftermatching the cpu array length.<br />
    -I was undecided which was better, because when the responses are low it is fun not to no if I got it wrong until I do all the inputs. Although, it seemed bothersome when the responses became longer and longer.<br />
